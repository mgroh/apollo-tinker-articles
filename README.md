# apollo-tinker-articles

This is a very very basic [graphql](https://graphql.org/) server written with [apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/server) that serves a bunch of test articles.
It's meant as a playground.

It can be run locally with `yarn start` or deployed on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) without any changes.
